# Word of Advice
You are your own person, you don't have to give a mere thought to some dude's political leaning. That being said, I do implore you to do research and discover such things on your own. My ideology is the result of that, not a pedantic shill of a theory being peddled by some quasi debate-bro/political commentator/propagandist media. Such is proper recourse for a just society. Question the system and those that control it; for you are your own person!

I don't care about convincing you my way is right: I'm telling you to find your own way. Don't look to others for guidance.

I'm very much open to civil discourse/debates on Politics, Economics, etc! Shoot me an email! I have much to learn in-life, but I'm making my way through it with a heavy heart, one step at a time!

That's all, thanks for reading. Have a blessed day!

Also, yes, I do constantly audit my commits, I have rampant OCD.
